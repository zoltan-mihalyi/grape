Folders
-------

- one-file: If you are developing a small game, and you don't need any module loader.
- required: If you have a lot of modules, it is recommended to use require.js.
- multiplayer: If you want to create a multiplayer game, you can see how easy it is.
- audio, img: Common resource files are stored here.

General
-------

In each directopry there are similar files.

- index.html: This is the production version of the game, you should create something similar when you release your game. To use this, you have to build the game (see below). 
- index.dev.html: If you are developing the game and the game engine is built, you use something like this.
- index.grape-dev.html: If you are developing the game engine itself, you can use this. It works without building anything.

TODO how to build?
